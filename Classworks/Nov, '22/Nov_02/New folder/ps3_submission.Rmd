# Solutions for Problem Set 3

```{r}
library(matlib)
```

```{r}
x = c(1,1,1,1,1,2,3,4,1,3,6,10,1,4,10,20)
M = matrix(x, nrow=4, byrow=F);M
```

```{r}
tr(M)
```

```{r}
R(M)
```

```{r}
Inverse(M)
```

```{r}
deter = 0
for(i in 1:4){
  deter = deter + M[1,i]*cofactor(M,1,i)
}; deter
```

```{r}
x1 = c(1,2,0)
x2 = c(8,1,-6)
x3 = c(0,0,1)
X = cbind(x1,x2,x3); X
GramSchmidt(X, normalize=TRUE, verbose=FALSE, tol=sqrt(.Machine$double.eps))
```

```{r}
M = matrix(0, nrow=4, ncol=3)
M[1,] = c(2, 3, 1)
M[2,] = c(1, 0, 4)
M[3,] = c(2, 4, 1)
M[4,] = c(0, 3, 2)

library(pracma)
rref(M)
```
Here  from the row reduced echelon form  of the Matrix we can see that the Rank is 3. Which means all the rows  of the matrix M are not Independent.
