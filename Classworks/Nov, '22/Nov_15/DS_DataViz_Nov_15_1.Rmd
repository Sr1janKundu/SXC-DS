```{r library_call}
library(tidyverse)
```

Let's start by looking at the `economics` dataset:
```{r}
head(economics)
glimpse(economics)
```

### Diagrams
```{r}
ggplot(data = economics, mapping = aes(x = date, y = uempmed)) + geom_line() + geom_point()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = economics, mapping = aes(x = date, y = uempmed)) + geom_line(color = "red", alpha = I(0.5))
```

> Add a title, a subtitle, x-axis label and y-axis labels by adding other layer(s).
